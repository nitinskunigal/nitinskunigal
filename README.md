## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub World! I'm Nitin Kunigal, an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in KPI tracking, operational reporting, and performance analysis within 3PL Supply Chain — now combining my industry experience with strong analytical skills to uncover actionable insights from data.

Recently, I completed a full-stack Business Intelligence (BI) project — from designing a data warehouse, automating ETL workflows, and performing advanced analytics in SQL Server to developing interactive dashboards in Power BI. 

Basically, I bring a business-first mindset — understanding how analytics ties into real-world decisions, costs, performance, and growth of an organization.
