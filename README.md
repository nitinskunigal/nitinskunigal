## 🚀 About Me

I'm a career-switcher with 1.5 years in B2B sales and 3 years in logistics operations — now combining my industry experience with strong analytical skills to uncover actionable insights from data.

My key project involved delivering a full-stack data solution — building a data warehouse in SQL Server, performing advanced SQL analytics, and developing interactive dashboards in Power BI. Through this, I’ve developed a solid foundation in KPI tracking, data modeling, and business storytelling.
