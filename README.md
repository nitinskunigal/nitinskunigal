## üöÄ About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub World! I'm Nitin Kunigal, an aspiring data/ BI analyst with a strong foundation in KPI tracking, operational reporting, and performance analysis within 3PL Supply Chain ‚Äî now combining my industry experience with strong analytical skills to uncover actionable insights from data.

Recently, I completed a full-stack Business Intelligence (BI) project ‚Äî from designing a data warehouse, automating ETL workflows, and performing advanced analytics in SQL Server to developing interactive dashboards in Power BI. 

Basically, I bring a business-first mindset ‚Äî understanding how analytics ties into real-world decisions, costs, performance, and growth of an organization.
