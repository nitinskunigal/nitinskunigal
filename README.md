## 🚀 About Me

I'm a career-switcher with over 4 years of experience in third-party logistics operations — now combining my industry experience with strong analytical skills to uncover actionable insights from data.

My key simulated project involves delivering a full-stack data solution — building a data warehouse in SQL Server, performing advanced SQL analytics, and developing interactive dashboards in Power BI. Through this, I’ve developed a solid foundation in end-to-end data analytics, KPI tracking, data modeling, and business storytelling. 

While internships are often seen as student-focused, I see them as a smart stepping stone for committed career switchers like me. So whether it’s an entry-level role or a meaningful internship, I’d love to be considered and contribute where it matters.
